# ISTIO Playground on Minishift

This project uses the Istio add-on for minishift in conjunction with the BookInfo application to create a clean setup for testing out ISTIO.

This was required as my ISTIO minishift would stop working after a restart, as some configuration seems to be transient.

## Pre-Reqs and Tested Environment
1. Red Hat CDK and Minishift
2. OpenShift verstion 3.10
3. minishift setup-cdk done
4. minishift profile uses 8GB of RAM and 4 cores, so you probably need more
5. Cloned minishift-addons repo https://github.com/minishift/minishift-addons
6. A base working knowledge of Minishift and OpenShift
7. ISTIO ctl configured and installed https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/download-release/

## Referenced Projects
1. https://github.com/minishift/minishift-addons/tree/master/add-ons/istio
2. https://github.com/Maistra/bookinfo

## Steps to run

### 1. Setup Minishift (Red Hat CDK)
1. Review step1_cdk.sh: Change the OpenShift version if required. Default 3.10.45
2. Run: step1_cdk.sh
3. Wait for minishift start up and verify that things are working

### 1. Setup Minishift (Origin)
1. Review step1_origin.sh: Change the OpenShift version if required. Default 3.10.0
2. Run: step1_origin.sh
3. Wait for minishift start up and verify that things are working

This will delete the servicemesh profile if it exists and create a new one

### 2. Install Istio Add-on
1. Review the step2.sh file: CHange the path to minishift-addons or run the file from outside the minishift-addons folder
2. Run the step2.sh file

This will install and enable istio as per the referenced addons project (https://github.com/minishift/minishift-addons/tree/master/add-ons/istio)

Wait for all the under istio system to become available. Elastic Search and Kiali are typically the last ones.

### 3. Install Book-Info
1. If you installed with mTLS enabled use the mlts versions of step3 else use the no_mtls version
1. Review the step3_[no_mtls|with_mtls].sh file
2. Run the step3_[no_mtls|with_mtls].sh file

This will install the Book Info demo under My Project for the admin user and expose a gateway using ISTIO. The path to the service can be found running echo $GATEWAY_URL/productpage

Once the services are running you can start playing around.

### 4. Things to try out
This section is Work in Progress
1. export the ISTIO gateway URL as an environment variable: export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc get route -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
2. echo $GATEWAY_URL
3. Send some load: while sleep .2; do curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage; done


### 5. Some Routing DEMOS
1. Routing to service 1 only: ./route_to_reviews_version_1.sh
2. Route based on user Jason: ./route_based_on_user.sh
3. Clean_up: ./reset_virtual_service.sh

### 6. Telemetry demos
1. Tracing: https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/distributed-tracing/
2. Prometheus queries: https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/querying-metrics/
3. Grafana: https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/using-istio-dashboard/

## TODO
1. Externalise variables
